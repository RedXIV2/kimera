    'From MSDN help on BROWSEINFO:

    'Flags specifying the options for the dialog box. This member can include zero or a _
     combination of the following values:
    'BIF_BROWSEFORCOMPUTER  Only return computers. If the user selects anything other _
                            than a computer, the OK button is grayed.
    'BIF_BROWSEFORPRINTER   Only return printers. If the user selects anything other _
                            than a printer, the OK button is grayed.
    'BIF_BROWSEINCLUDEFILES Version 4.71. The browse dialog will display files as well as folders.
    'BIF_BROWSEINCLUDEURLS  Version 5.0. The browse dialog box can display URLs. _
                            The BIF_USENEWUI and BIF_BROWSEINCLUDEFILES flags must also be set. _
                            If these three flags are not set, the browser dialog box will reject URLs. _
                            Even when these flags are set, the browse dialog box will only display URLs _
                            if the folder that contains the selected item supports them. _
                            When the folder's IShellFolder::GetAttributesOf method is called to request _
                            the selected item's attributes, the folder must set the SFGAO_FOLDER _
                            attribute flag. Otherwise, the browse dialog box will not display the URL.
    'BIF_DONTGOBELOWDOMAIN  Do not include network folders below the domain level in the _
                            dialog box's tree view control.
    'BIF_EDITBOX            Version 4.71. Include an edit control in the browse dialog box _
                            that allows the user to type the name of an item.
    'BIF_NEWDIALOGSTYLE     Version 5.0. Use the new user interface. Setting this flag provides _
                            the user with a larger dialog box that can be resized. _
                            The dialog box has several new capabilities including: _
                            drag and drop capability within the dialog box, reordering, _
                            context menus, new folders, delete, and other context menu commands. _
                            To use this flag, you must call OleInitialize or CoInitialize _
                            before calling SHBrowseForFolder.
    'BIF_RETURNFSANCESTORS  Only return file system ancestors. An ancestor is a subfolder _
                            that is beneath the root folder in the namespace hierarchy. _
                            If the user selects an ancestor of the root folder that is not _
                            part of the file system, the OK button is grayed.
    'BIF_RETURNONLYFSDIRS   Only return file system directories. If the user selects folders _
                            that are not part of the file system, the OK button is grayed.
    'BIF_SHAREABLE          Version 5.0. The browse dialog box can display shareable resources _
                            on remote systems. It is intended for applications that want to _
                            expose remote shares on a local system. The BIF_USENEWUI flag must also be set.
    'BIF_STATUSTEXT         Include a status area in the dialog box. The callback function _
                            can set the status text by sending messages to the dialog box.
    'BIF_USENEWUI           Version 5.0. Use the new user interface, including an edit box. _
                            This flag is equivalent to BIF_EDITBOX | BIF_NEWDIALOGSTYLE. _
                            To use BIF_USENEWUI, you must call OleInitialize or CoInitialize _
                            before calling SHBrowseForFolder.
    'BIF_VALIDATE           Version 4.71. If the user types an invalid name into the edit box, _
                            the browse dialog will call the application's BrowseCallbackProc _
                            with the BFFM_VALIDATEFAILED message. _
                            This flag is ignored if BIF_EDITBOX is not specified.
